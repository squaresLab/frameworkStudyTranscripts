##Summary of files in repository

AndroidCodingFrameAndTranscripts.pdf begins with the coding frame used in the android study.
Then we summarize each trial with the coding frame. Each trial starts with the participant number,
task number, and fault number in the trial. The order of the file is the order that the trials
were transcribed (so you might have to control-f search for a trial you want). The timestamps in 
the file were used to aid in creating the summaries, so they probably are not of interest to 
you. Each summary line starts with the coding category number (for example, a line that 
starts with 3) means that the event in the summary is a question that developers asked 
while debugging). The rest of the line is the qualitative summary of what the participant 
did.

ROSCodingFrame.pdf is the coding frame used in the ROS experiments. 

ROSCodedTranscripts.pdf is the summaries of partipants in the study. Each task starts with a 
participant.ROSTask indicator (e.g., 1.1 means partipant 1 of the ROS Task and the first ROS 
task, TR1 in the paper). Each line starts with the number or letter that cooresponds to the 
coding category from ROSCodingFrame.pdf, and indicates how we coded the action that 
follows in the rest of the line. The rest of the line is the summary of what that participants
did at that point in the trial.
